TOPP-RA is a library for time-parameterizing robot trajectories subject to kinematic and dynamic constraints. 
In general, given the inputs:

1. a geometric path `q(s)`, `s` in `[0, s_end]` ;
2. a list of constraints on joint velocity, joint accelerations, tool Cartesian velocity, et cetera.

TOPP-RA returns the time-parameterization: `s_dot (s)`, from which a trajectory `q(t)` that satisfies the given
constraints can be computed.

## Citing TOPP-RA
If you use this library for your research, we encourage you to 

1. reference the accompanying paper [«A new approach to Time-Optimal Path Parameterization based on Reachability Analysis»](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07239), *IEEE Transactions on Robotics*, vol. 34(3), pp. 645–659, 2018.

## Bug reports and supports
Please report any issues, questions via [Github issues tracker](https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra/issues).

It will be very helpful if you can provide more details on the
errors/bugs that you encounter. In fact, the best way is to provide a
Minimal Working Example that produces the reported bug and attach it
with the issue report.
