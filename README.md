# Overview

**toppra** is a library for computing the time-optimal path
parametrization for robots subject to kinematic and dynamic
constraints.  In general, given the inputs:

1. a geometric path `p(s)`, `s` in `[0, s_end]`;
2. a list of constraints on joint velocity, joint accelerations, tool
   Cartesian velocity, et cetera.

**toppra** returns the time-optimal path parameterization: `s_dot
(s)`, from which the fastest trajectory `q(t)` that satisfies the
given constraints can be found.

**Documentation and tutorials** are available
[here](https://hungpham2511.github.io/toppra/index.html).

You can install the package with pip:

``` shell
pip install toppra
```

To install from source for development:

``` shell
pip install -r requirement3.txt
pip install -e .
```
