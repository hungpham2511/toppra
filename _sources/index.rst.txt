TOPP-RA: Fast path-parameterization for robots
===================================================

TOPP-RA is a library for computing :ref:`path parametrizations
<path-parametrization>` for arbitrary robot geometric
paths/trajectories. It can account for several types of constraints:

1. joint torque, velocity and acceleration bounds;
2. *robust* joint torque, velocity and acceleration bounds;
3. Cartesian acceleration bounds;
4. contact stability for legged robots.
5. Your constraint! See the tutorials to understand how to implement
   your own constraints and handle them with TOPP-RA.

For a given path, TOPP-RA can compute both its *time-optimal* path
parametrization as well as a time-parametrization with a *specified
duration*.

TOPP-RA is efficient. For standard use cases, it should return a
solution in 5ms-10ms.
